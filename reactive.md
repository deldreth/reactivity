# Reactive Programming

Textbook definition:

> declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change

Normally the expression `a = b + c` has initialized the value of `a` with the intent that that value would be used later. Any changes to the values of the expression don't change the value of `a`.

Reactive programming concerns itself with what the value of `a` would become if either `b` or `c` were to change.
